# expense_tracker
 This is a Flutter mobile app called Expense Tracker, it simply lets user record any expenses within seven days(a week). The app will then generate a bar chart representing total amount of money spent on each weekday. The user is able to:
 1. Add a new transaction (title, amount, date required)
 2. Delete an existing transaction (by pressing the delete icon button)

Todo:
1. Add a search bar / filter so that users can search or filter out specific transactions
2. Add a summary section which displays total amount of money users spent within current week
